# Red Dead Redemption 2 Blackjack Monte Carlo simulation

A Monte Carlo approach to RDR2's Gambler Challenge Rank 8.

The idea of the challenge is to win three hands of Blackjack, with three hits or more, so we have to win while having at least five cards in hand.
This project aims to estimate the number of rounds needed to achieve it.
